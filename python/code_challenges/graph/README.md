# Graphs
A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices potentially connected by line segments named edges.

## Challenge
Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:
- add node
- add edge
- get nodes
- get neighbors
- size
